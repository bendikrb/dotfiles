This is my personal collection of dotfiles for various shells and tools.

To use it, you need to do the following:

    git clone git://github.com/martinp/dotfiles.git

Then you can create symlinks by running the included script

    ./symlinks.sh

If you want to force overwrite of existing dotfiles in your $HOME, use the --force flag

    ./symlinks.sh --force

(NOTE: This will delete your existing dotfiles)
